# What data/business/research/personal question you would like to answer?

Which brand will be the best positioned during the beginning of 2021?

# What is the hypothesis you would like to test in order to answer your question?

Coca Cola will be the best positioned brand, being in the minds and whims of most consumers, in addition to having very high sales.

# How will you test your hypothesis?

With the data produced by the analysis using the Semantic Brand Score

# What is your dataset about?

A csv file with all the tweets obtained by performing web scraping and calling the Twitter API during the months of February and March 2021.

## Data Exploration and Visualization

As a first step, I wrote the code that allowed me to get all the tweets in English that had the mentions in hashtags of most of the well-known brands of mass consumer products.

Later, I transformed the file into a pandas dataframe that allowed me to carry out the necessary cleaning to perform the analysis with the Semantic Brand Score. that includes removing even unnecessary characters with Regex, which by the way, I still hate.

With the dataset ready and very clean, perform the measurements with Semantic Bran Score, saving the results in separate csv files to be able to perform the visualizations with Tableau Public, of which I leave the link below.
